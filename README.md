#### Week #4: Git  (August 29th, 2023)
- **Type:** Presentation & Workshop
- **Deliverable:** Results of the Workshop
- **Description:** Git is the main source code management tools for code versioning into repositories, regardless of whether you use Github, Gitlab, etc. SCM is important for DevOps because it is one of the foundations for CI/CD pipelines, and also helps teams to organize code and follow a workflow that can be connected with tickets over Jira or other Agile tools.
- **Goal:** Understand what git does, and how to apply it to projects involving source code, managing branches, and knowing patterns for it.

#### Week #5: Cloud

#### Week #6: CI/CD
- **Type:** Presentation & Workshop
- **Deliverable:** Results of the Workshop
- **Description:** CI/CD practices are one of the core abilities for a DevOps Engineer. Continuous integration and continuous delivery (and deployment) help the development teams to automate the build and deployment of the applications for non-production and production environments, finding bugs and errors in the code and artifacts in a short period of time, making the feedback go faster down the stream and improving the development times from the coding to the deployment.
- **Goal:** Understand what CI/CD is, develop pipelines to automate code development, testing, and deployment using standard tools for the industry.

#### Week #7: Databases
- **Type:** Presentation & Workshop
- **Goal:** Understand the basics of databases, SQL, NoSQL, and database management systems.

#### Week #8: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Type:** Presentation & Workshop
- **Goal:** Understand the concept of IaC, its benefits, and popular tools like Terraform and CloudFormation.

#### Week #9: Configuration Management
- **Type:** Presentation & Workshop
- **Deliverable:** Results of the Workshop
- **Description:** Configuration Management is the process of maintaining servers, VMs or computers changes in a desired, consistent state. Removing the need to configure them manually or through custom scripts, reducing complexity and errors. Making systems management predictable and scalable, and taking all the advantages of Infrastructure as Code such as version control, testing, and modularity.
- **Goal:** Understand what Configuration Management is, its benefits, and how to use a common tool such as Ansible.

#### Week #10: Virtualization vs Containerization
