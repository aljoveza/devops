### Workshop Agenda

**Part 1: Introduction to Containers and Docker**

* Dive into the world of containers and understand why they have revolutionized modern application deployment. Learn how Docker simplifies containerization and enhances portability.

**Part 2: Docker Compose and Multi-Container Applications**

* Explore Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications effortlessly. Discover how to define, link, and scale containers within a single application.

**Part 3: Introduction to Kubernetes**

* Uncover the fundamentals of Kubernetes, the industry-standard container orchestration platform. Set up your own Kubernetes cluster, and learn how to deploy and manage pods.

**Part 4: Kubernetes Deployment and Services**

* Master the art of Kubernetes Deployments and Services. Understand how to ensure application availability, perform rolling updates, and balance loads efficiently.

**Part 5: Advanced Kubernetes Concepts**

* Delve into advanced Kubernetes concepts like ConfigMaps, Secrets, StatefulSets, and Helm for effective application configuration and management.

**Part 6: Container Orchestration with Kubernetes**

* Learn why container orchestration is essential and how Kubernetes excels at it. Explore scaling, load balancing, and configuration management in a Kubernetes environment.

### Prerequisites

To make the most of this workshop, participants should have:

* Basic knowledge of Linux and command-line operations.
* Familiarity with software development and basic networking concepts.
* A laptop with administrative rights (for local installations).

### Workshop Format

Our workshop combines hands-on experience with in-depth theoretical knowledge. You'll not only learn about Docker and Kubernetes but also put that knowledge to work through practical exercises and demonstrations.

### What You'll Gain

By the end of this workshop, you will:

* Understand the core concepts of containers and containerization.
* Be proficient in Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes.
* Have hands-on experience deploying and managing containerized applications.
* Gain insights into container orchestration best practices
