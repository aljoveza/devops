## Part 5: Advanced Kubernetes Concepts

Based on the content that you can [find in the repo](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/devops/modules/10.Containers/Part5), follow the following steps to to configure the application using volumes:

1. **Fill pod-volume.yaml to add a volume to expose the current directory. Then using kubectl create the pod and ensure it's running. Then create a custom loadbalancer taking as example service.yaml to expose kubernetes port 8000 through machine port 2850.**
